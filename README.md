# Fashion-MNIST-GAN---Part-2-Data-Loading-Visualization-and-Model-Refinement


### Project Description
This part of the project focuses on preparing the Fashion MNIST dataset for training the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and visualizing sample images from the dataset. The notebook sets up the environment in Google Colab, loads the dataset using PyTorch, and provides data transformations such as normalization. It also includes steps to visualize the data, making it easier to understand the input going into the model.

### Steps in this Notebook
Mount Google Drive: The project begins by mounting Google Drive in a Colab environment to save and access datasets and generated images.

### Installing Required Libraries:

imageio for handling image files.
torchvision for loading the Fashion MNIST dataset and applying transformations.

### Loading and Preprocessing the Data:

Downloading the Fashion MNIST dataset using torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST.
Applying transformations to normalize the image pixel values to the range [-1, 1].
Using DataLoader to load the data in batches, which helps in efficient processing for training.
Visualizing Sample Images: A batch of 25 images is displayed in a grid using Matplotlib, showing the types of clothing items present in the dataset. This step helps confirm that the data has been loaded and processed correctly.


### Data Visualization: 
After loading the dataset, the notebook shows a grid of 25 images, helping you verify the type of clothing items being processed for GAN training.

### Technologies Used:
Python
PyTorch
Torchvision
Matplotlib
Future Work
Integrate this part with Part 1 of the project, where the GAN model is defined.
Implement training loops for the GAN using this data.
Visualize the generated images from the GAN and evaluate the quality of fake images over time.
